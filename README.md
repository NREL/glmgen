omf-glm-generator
=================

Private version of public fork https://github.com/elainethale/omf. Forking to use PNNL's latest taxonomy feeder generator code as a starting point for our purposes. (The omf project is a web application to make it easier for MILSOFT users to evaluate grid technology changes.)
